An examination of the writers’ attention to topics such as (colonialism, ethnic war, gender oppression, migration, and Afropolitanism) allows for a critical analysis of the historical, social, and political issues on the African continent. The authors’ discussions about globalization and its impact on African nations, particularly in relationship to the global marketplace, highlight the paradoxical nature of Africa’s rich natural resources (oil, diamonds and coltan) against the continent’s economic dependency on global investors. Postcolonialism, Feminism, and Psychoanalytic theory will enrich students’ interpretation and analysis of the texts.",

    "description": "AFH 215 - Hip Hop and the Intellectual Tradition Examines the world of hip-hop, by framing it within the fields of intellectual theory and examining the scholarly and artistic contributions of rap artists, writers, and scholars who intellectualize the global and cultural phenomenon of Hip Hop. This course will attempt to complicate the largely historical and non-theoretical treatment of hip hop in mass-mediated portrayals by engaging in a cultural studies critique of youth cultural formations and the rapid global industrialization of hip-hop. The course will also highlight how contemporary issues concerning racial and gender politics, sexual orientation, globalization, and neocolonialism are tackled by the music and culture.",
