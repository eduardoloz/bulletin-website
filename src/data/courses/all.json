An examination of the writers’ attention to topics such as (colonialism, ethnic war, gender oppression, migration, and Afropolitanism) allows for a critical analysis of the historical, social, and political issues on the African continent. The authors’ discussions about globalization and its impact on African nations, particularly in relationship to the global marketplace, highlight the paradoxical nature of Africa’s rich natural resources (oil, diamonds and coltan) against the continent’s economic dependency on global investors. Postcolonialism, Feminism, and Psychoanalytic theory will enrich students’ interpretation and analysis of the texts.",

Lectures and practical exercises teach students how to document the archaeological record and how to use it to test hypotheses about early human behavior. Field excursions teach archaeological survey and excavation techniques. Students conduct research and report their findings in writing and in oral presentations.

Major exhibitions of their art and new scholarship have dispelled myths about the quality or supposed limitations of art by women, challenged the traditional boundaries of the objects of art history, and demonstrated a broad public desire to know more about women artists of the past. Through the careers and works of artists including Clara Peeters, Sofonisba Anguissola, Artemisia Gentileschi, Lavinia Fontana, Judith Leyster, Luisa Roldán, and Maria Sibylla Merian we will consider what it took to succeed as a woman artist and how success itself is defined for women, historically and today. Though the focus is on artists active in Europe, we will also consider themes of the global early modern world through topics such as still life painting and natural history, convent networks and nuns’ works, and international collecting and exhibition in the early modern period and today, Focused studies of individual artists will open to broad thematic discussions of topics such as feminist and gender history, the intersection of art and science, and the historiography of art writing.",

Rather than treating pop culture as mere entertainment, we will approach it as a set of expressive forms that reveal deeper questions about tradition and modernity, identity and nation, gender and power. Through close reading, visual analysis, and contextual interpretation, Students will critically engage with cultural texts - such as Korean dramas, Japanese anime, Chinese historical epics, and short-form video platforms like Douyin. We will examine how these artifacts draw on long-standing cultural conventions while responding to new global currents. Through this work, students will gain an appreciation for the complexity of East Asian cultural production and develop interpretive skills central to the humanities. 3 credits SBC: GLO, HUM",

In this Asian film course, we explore the various cinemas of India and the Indian diaspora such as Bollywood cinema, art cinema, films by Indian directors inside and outside India, music videos, and documentaries. Factors behind its ascent to the most popular art form as well as a lucrative medium of entertainment and potent vehicle for social change not only in India but also beyond its shores are examined in some depth. We discover how these various Indian cinemas address and depict the social mores, cultural practices and political issues of the South Asian subcontinent. Themes for our discussions include but are not limited to nationalism, sexuality, censorship, activism, tradition, modernity, identity, gender roles, and the pleasures and politics of song, dance and music, as we look at historical, thematic and aesthetic issues of these cinemas and their impact and influence in India as well as globally.",

We will consider the great Heian Era women writers and their culture, examining the difference between men’s and women’s writing. From the Heian era we will move to the Meiji Era, when Japan’s isolationist period had ended and centuries’ worth of Western literature was introduced to Japan. We will concentrate on the writings of Higuchi Ichiyo, noting how the position of women had changed by her day and how it affected her literary style. The course will close with a focus on how literature treats Japanese women in our own time.",

Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo’s criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan’s literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well.",

We will also study characteristic modes of atmospheric and climate variability (e.g., El Niño-Southern Oscillation).",

It is designed to familiarize students with some fundamental knowledge of the structure of spoken and written Mandarin Chinese. Specifically, it aims to enable the students to acquire an understanding of basic methods used by linguists to observe and gather Mandarin Chinese data, to delineate structural properties with regard to the sound, tone, word, grammar, and discourse of the language, and to develop a basic typological comparison between Mandarin Chinese and English.",

How did we become aware - culturally and scientifically - of the crisis? What are the cascading impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services? How can we imagine moving through the impasse and emerging on the other side? What are the political opportunities and blockages? How can we change our societies to be less energy intensive and more adaptable to the warming already baked into the climate system? What kinds of engineered solutions - carbon sequestering and clean energy, for example - are here or on the horizon?

AI Ecologies is based on the idea that examining these relations and their role in our shared lives requires more than just one perspective. In response, this course brings together researchers from a variety of disciplines and perspectives to share their approaches to AI in real time. It is designed for first- and second-year undergraduates from all disciplines. The course introduces students to technical, interpretive, and humanistic vocabulary necessary to critically engage with pressing professional, ethical, and civic challenges posed by twenty-first-century AI.

Real-life examples are used to examine how computer software and the internet allow us to better understand a problem, analyze a question, or find an answer. Computers are used intensively to learn about financial and business decisions, economic models, and econometric methodology. Models of inter-temporal choice, investment, investment under uncertainty, migration, retirement, housing decisions, economics of regulation, education, financial options, and many others are explored with real examples, often with real data and econometric tools. Students are expected to consult many sources and think analytically for problem sets, exams, and in class.",

The students will have the opportunity to leverage theoretical knowledge acquired during ESE 272 and ESE 273 to design and test more complex and highly popular electronic circuits such as multi-stage amplifier, voltage regulator, and DC-DC boost and buck converters, data converters, and phase-locked loop. The initial several experiments will be based on the fundamental single stage amplifiers. The rest of the experiments will be more design centric where students will have the responsibility to determine either topology or the values of the circuit elements in each experiment in order to satisfy specific design objectives. The lectures will cover the theoretical principles as well as related design tradeoffs. Different topologies and analysis techniques will be presented for each circuit, guiding students during the design process.",

At the same time, we are a society which prizes personal responsibility and seeks out individual attention and expression. How do we keep a population safe and healthy while respecting our highly individualized national character? This course examines this tension through reference to novels, narrative accounts, drama, and essays where you will have an opportunity to think through these seminal ‘threshold’ questions on your own.",

This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies. Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages–proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review–culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration.

We will read works from several critical pedagogy theorists to explore and analyze some of the key themes within critical pedagogy (education & power; difference & pluralism; transformative education; the social construction of knowledge; dialogic relations in the classroom; teaching for social justice).

    "description": "HIS 239 - From Columbus to Darwin: Investigating Nature, Medicine, and Science in the Americas From the 16th to the 19th century, Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans all contributed to new knowledge production in the Americas in the realms of natural history, medicine, and early science. Within various colonial contexts, the drive to find, collect, and, where possible, commodify native plants, animals, and peoples played critical roles in larger contests to control people and places. As competing imperial powers sought to exploit natural resources and reshape entire regions in the service of empire, Indians and enslaved Africans variously resisted or contributed to those efforts. This course explores how changing concepts of the natural world impacted the development of science, medicine, and technology and influenced concepts of race, gender, class, and human adaptability. Readings will include current works by historians and other scholars as well as primary documents ranging from fantastical early travel narratives, to revealing accounts of Indian and African American medical/spiritual practitioners, to increasingly empirical studies by surveyors, engineers, and scientists in the 19th century.",

Travel was a central feature of the medieval world and one of the primary factors that contributed to cultural contact, communication, exchange, and the diffusion of ideas between Europe, Africa and Asia in the pre-modern era. This course will explore the interconnected histories of the medieval world, focusing primarily on the Mediterranean world¿Latin Christendom, Byzantium and the Islamic world¿between roughly 500 and 1700. It will also devote attention to travel and travelers in the Atlantic world (including West Africa), the Indian Ocean, Central Asia, and China during the same period. Whether the motivation was exploration, piety, knowledge, survival, or profit, the act of travel involved the travelers in larger processes of interaction and exchange between cultures. We will examine the lives and accounts of pilgrims, merchants, scholars, slaves, and soldiers to investigate what motivated people to travel to, from, or within regions throughout the medieval world, and how they portrayed their experiences. With an emphasis on primary sources and class discussion, we will explore the writings of a diverse group of travelers and situate them within their larger social, cultural, and political contexts, while at the same time coming to terms with their reasons for travel and their particular world view.",

At war with indigenous peoples in its empire for almost the entire century, and faced with restive and even revolutionary laborers, Irish Home Rulers and suffragettes on the domestic front, Victorians formulated imaginary solutions to the real social and political problems faced at home and in the colonies, and these formulations of monsters, social or supernatural impacted nothing less than western conceptions of modernity itself. National and imperial developments across hemispheric and transoceanic space provide the larger contexts for the two assigned novels (about monsters) and historical narratives and primary sources (about Victorian society).

In particular, we will attend to the impact of decolonization on issues of race, class and gender within British domestic culture. Britain entered the 20th century as the world’s premier imperial power, the barometer of global technological, cultural, political and intellectual developments. As the empire disintegrated, wracked by world wars and nationalist revolts, the British state took up a different kind of revolution – a ‘socialist’ revolution–that sought to give its citizens economic and social security ‘from the cradle to the grave.’ At the same time, British society was significantly enlivened, and further transformed, by the influx of immigrants from former colonies and the Commonwealth. The second half of the twentieth century thus marked the successes and failures of the twinned projects of socialism and decolonization, while also producing new kinds of mass cultural exports that continue to shape global culture. These narratives of changing configurations of empire, class, race, gender and politics are the subject of our course, and will be explored through imaginative and historical literature and film.",

Unit 1 (Ultimate Aspects of Sex) will review hypotheses related to recombination and anisogamy (different sized gametes), continuing on to sexual selection theory, which is the theoretical backbone for understanding sex differences in morphology and behavior. In Unit 2 (Proximate Aspects of Sex), we take a step back and discuss the genetic and hormonal mechanisms governing sex-typical development. Here we will also address alternative pathways of sexual differentiation, the physiological underpinnings of sexual motivation and sexual response, and puberty. Finally, in Unit 3 (Human Sexuality), we will take these two approaches and apply them to questions of human sexuality, addressing controversial topics such as mate choice, sexuality, sexual coercion, as well as more curious topics such as the evolution of the female orgasm and external testes.",

We will then use this foundation to address why species and individuals vary in the pattern and tempo of development, reproduction, and senescence. In the process, we will address questions such as: Why do humans invest so much in offspring and what factors influence individual differences in parental investment? What is the function of menopause? What is the purpose of a prolonged juvenile period (i.e., childhood)? And when and why should the pace of development accelerate or slow down? We will examine these questions from a comparative perspective, drawing not just on studies focusing on humans, but also on those focusing on nonhuman primates and other mammals.",

Few people will ever witness a journalist in action. Yet many have very specific ideas of what journalists do because they have read about journalists in novels, short stories and comic books, and they have seen them in movies, television, plays, and cartoons.

In parallel with the colonial push into the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, journalistic narratives start to shape the Western view of the new worlds. But the process has a dual nature: these styles and genres are appropriated, re-signified and repurposed locally, giving birth to an array of journalisms that do not conform with their Western counterparts. Crónicas, corridos, roman feuilleton, and a vast number of other forms of journalisms born in the Global South are discussed during this course. The class aims at expanding the Western idea of journalism as the watchdog of democracy, and to understanding journalism in the Global South in its historical context, within its political, pedagogical and literary roles.",

We start out by understanding how humans form social networks and what the properties of these networks are. We then compare how the emergence of social media has changed the manner in which we humans communicate, and investigate possible positive and negative effects of this change. One of the major effects is that many more people are ‘publishing’ today, and we will discover how this has affected public language use. We also discuss the technology behind social media, and learn about the dangers in social media. We also discuss the technologies used in social media, and learn about the potential and the dangers that lie in these technologies.",

In the past few decades we have started to recognize how the loss of these species has caused substantial changes in terrestrial ecosystem diversity and function, mediated by changes in prey population dynamics and behavior. It is only recently that we have realized that changes in the abundance of apex predators in the ocean (e.g., sharks, marine mammals, tuna and other large predatory bony fish) may be causing similar changes in coastal and pelagic marine ecosystems. In this course we will (1) review the biology of key marine apex predators, (2) explore how ‘top down’ processes (predation and intimidation of prey) can influence marine ecosystems and (3) review the status of marine apex predators and how this relates to the current state of ocean ecosystems. We will draw from the primary literature, from both the terrestrial and marine realms, and host outside speakers who study these animals in the field.",

However, scholars have recently begun to explore the possibility that biological differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political attitudes and behavior. This course explores the relationship between biology and political behavior with an emphasis on how the two may be linked. We examine human political behavior from evolutionary, genetic, and neurobiological perspectives, considering literature on non-human animals, developmental psychology, personality, psychophysiology, neurobiology, genetics, hormones, disgust sensitivity, and mating.",

Using real nonprofits or other organizations as an example, students will apply theories of organizational rhetoric, visual rhetoric, genre, and more to analyze the ways in which a business internally communicates and externally presents itself in its public facing texts and artifacts particularly with an eye toward diversity, equity and inclusion and assumed power structures. For the first half of the class, students will choose a business or nonprofit organization to formally research, analyze and create content for. Genres include an organizational rhetorical analysis report, a writing profile, a researched spotlight brief and a video message. Students will then present their work in a 10 to 15-minute formal presentation, peer reviewed by the class. The second half of the semester, the class will partner with one or more businesses or local nonprofits through Stony Brook University’s Center for Service Learning and Community Service (CSLCS). Using an asset based approach, students will work in groups to collaborate with the organization(s) to learn their needs then using what they learned from the first half, write mini white papers which will then be combined into a Collaborative White Paper for the organization(s).",

This involves knowing how to use appropriate databases, source materials, and composing processes, as well as negotiating the values, genres, and languages of the scholarly communities in which one is researching. In this course, students will learn fundamentals of research methods, practice these methods in a series of integrated research and writing assignments, and engage in critical reflection about research and writing. Students will focus on an area of disciplinary interest to them, and practice these essential research and writing skills through a series of projects: library assignments, research log, research proposal, annotated bibliography, literature review, abstract, research paper and reflection paper.",

This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies. Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages–proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review–culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration.
